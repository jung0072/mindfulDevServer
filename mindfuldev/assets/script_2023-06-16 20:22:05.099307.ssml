As an AI language model, I cannot provide medical advice. However, I can suggest some general lifestyle changes that may help you in regulating your dopamine levels:

1. Exercise: Regular exercise can help release endorphins, which in turn can increase dopamine levels.

2. A Healthy Diet: Consuming a balanced diet, rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, can help regulate dopamine levels in the brain.

3. Sleep well: Getting enough sleep at night can help regulate the production of dopamine.

4. Meditation: Regular meditation can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can lead to increased dopamine levels.

5. Avoid Drugs and Alcohol: Drugs and alcohol can alter dopamine levels and cause addiction, which can damage your brain's natural ability to produce dopamine.
