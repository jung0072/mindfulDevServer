As an AI language model, I cannot predict the future. However, based on current trends and developments, AI is likely to advance in the areas of natural language processing, image and speech recognition, predictive analytics, and automation. AI is also expected to play a more significant role in industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, transforming the way we work and live. Additionally, AI's potential impact on the job market and the ethical implications of its development and use may become more apparent in the next two years.
